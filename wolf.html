  	<h1>Favorite animal</h1>

  	<img src="wolf.jpg" alt="Wolf staring at screen">

  	 <p>Wolfs are my favorite animal because, they are hunters. They are smart animals and know how to survive even the toughest of times. They travel in groups set up to protect the pack from pretators. They are the largest members of the dog family.</p>
